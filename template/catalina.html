					<p><span class="firstcharacter">M</span>ost faculty and students don’t get to see a beautiful ocean sunrise or a pod of dolphins on their commute to class. But for researchers at USC’s environmental center on Catalina Island, this is part of an average day. <br><br>

A 5 a.m. wake-up call to beat traffic on the I-110 Freeway and 90 minutes on turbulent waters separate staff and students from the University of Southern California Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies on Catalina. USC’s personal vessel, the Miss Christi, is the University’s shuttle on the sea, transporting visitors to the island at least five days a week, just over 25 nautical miles from the port of San Pedro to the Wrigley Institute.<br><br>

The Wrigley Marine Science Center was founded by Philip K. Wrigley, son of chewing gum magnate William Wrigley Jr. and a dedicated environmentalist who donated his family’s ownership of most of Catalina Island for conservation. The USC Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies opened as an extension of the Marine Science Center in 1995, as a dedicated space for research in sustainable initiatives. Since then, the island has been a model for implementation of sustainable practices and hotbed for environmental research.<br><br>

Some notable projects hosted on Catalina include a large-scale measurement of metal contamination in Southern California’s coastal waters, monitoring how light pollution affects coastal marine animal species, exploring the evolution of the endangered Channel Islands Fox and ongoing research in food sustainability from aquaponics gardening to revolutionary methods of composting with the help of Black Soldier Flies. <br><br>

Diane Kim, the associate director of the Wrigley Institute, is working on a project to convert kelp into a biofuel that could someday replace gasoline. <br><br>

“It’s pretty straightforward … and I think there’s a lot of power in that, that a lot of really innovative solutions are also simple ones,” Kim said. <br><br>

The process of turning kelp, a species of macroalgae, into a biofuel is done through hydrothermal liquefaction. This involves drying the kelp, then processing the biomass in an extremely hot, pressurized and wet environment for long periods of time to allow the breakdown of the solid chemical structure. Typically, the product of this process is a biocrude, which can be further distilled or processed into a fuel that can be used just like any petroleum-based fuel. <br><br>

Kim and her colleagues, a team of faculty, undergraduate and graduate researchers from USC as well as partners at eco-tech company Marine BioEnergy of Pasadena, have been working on this kelp endeavor for about two years now. The key to their work is cooperation, involving specialists such as chemical engineers from Pacific Northwest National Laboratories and business analysts from Marine BioEnergy who are looking into the future commercialization of kelp as a biofuel.<br><br>

Rilee Sanders and Tristan Jordan-Huffman, two first-year graduate students at USC, have been working on the project as field research assistants. The pair spent this past summer out on the island doing two to three dives per day to monitor juvenile kelp plants and determine the optimal timing for stationing the kelp in the ocean.<br><br>

In other countries, researchers have already been looking into kelp as a biofuel source for the last few years. However, the researchers at Wrigley and Marine BioEnergy have come up with an innovative way to farm the massive amounts of kelp necessary for a commercialized fuel source: a so-called “kelp elevator.” The current prototype models use PVC pipes in the ocean to grow the kelp and cycle them from the surface where the light is to the deep water where the nutrients are.<br><br>

“We’re talking about areas almost the size of the United States in total, so you need a lot of space to do that,” Kim said.<br><br>

The solution is to go out into the open ocean, away from the coast, which humans already heavily rely on for resources and recreation. Kelp need both the light from the surface and the nutrients from the deep bottom-water. <br><br>

“Instead of taking the nutrients to the kelp, we’re taking the kelp to the nutrients,” Kim said, adding that the toughest part is working against the currents. <br><br>

Eventually they hope the growing model will be much more technologically advanced. <br><br>

“We don’t want to battle the ocean, we want to go with the flow literally, so we want this free-floating autonomous farm that’s pulled by drones that are powered by solar,” Kim said.<br><br>

It sounds like a Jetsons-esque fate, but this could be the reality of a future without fossil fuels. Kelp is one of the fastest growing plants on the planet, according to Sanders, and unlike traditionally farmed plants, it requires no fresh water, fertilizer, pesticides or fertile land. These attributes make kelp a viable potential substitute for traditional fuels, as it can be sustainably farmed, harvested, and converted into biofuel.<br><br>

The Wrigley Center’s research is part of a larger effort to get the United States’ biofuel production caught up to the rest of the world. Other countries, like Sweden and Japan, have been farming kelp on large scales for decades as they take advantage of kelp’s nutritional benefits as part of their regular diet. Thus, they already have a working kelp-farming infrastructure to use and build off of.<br><br>

But the faculty and students working on the project at the Wrigley Institute are optimistic that they can overcome these early hurdles and revolutionize the fuel industry.<br><br>

“If we can not only prove that it can be done, but that it can be done efficiently and in a competitive way with other biofuels then it really has the potential to be a leading factor in the industry,” Jordan-Huffman said. <br><br>

Kim stressed that the team is not in it for profit, but said the Wrigley Institute will continue its research until kelp fuel is commercially competitive with other fuel types.<br><br>

“The Wrigley Institute supports any project that is looking for sustainable solutions to some of our biggest environmental challenges, and energy is certainly one of those,” Kim said. <br><br>

Sanders has a lot of faith in his colleagues. He noted the importance of having dedicated researchers in specific areas — including ocean conservation, chemical engineering and economics — so that they can become experts on these relatively new scientific developments. <br><br>

“What we’re attempting to do … is really transformative for the future in terms of biofuel usage and just the possibilities that exist when you put smart people together and figure some things out,” Sanders said.
